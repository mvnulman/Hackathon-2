## Description

Job Finder Website -  Second Hackathon project realized within Developers Institute JavaScript Bootcamp.

The idea and concept of this project it's to simulate a Job Finder Website, where developers can search about job opportunities through the description of the job role. And, it's also possible to add and register new opportunities of jobs, using the database to store and show the this new data. 

This project was developed to cover principals and fundamentals of:
- Connect the frontend with the backend, using NodeJs as a server and store data in the database using SQlite3;
- Practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript;
- Learn new technology as "Handlebars" and learn how to handle the functionality and possible errors during the development;
- Since I started to learn about database with PostegreSQL and PGAdmin, It was good to challenge myself learning about another database solution as SQlite3 and understand how it works.
- Improve myself in using NodeJs and their dependencies as Nodemon, Express, Body parser and others.

#### Technologies

- SQLite3
- HTML
- CSS / Bootstrap
- HandleBars
- JavaScript
- NodeJs
